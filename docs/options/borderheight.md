# -borderheight

Parameter: `integer`

Force the map border heights to the specified signed integer value. The default value is 0.

This setting changes all map borders to that height. These heights are stored in the heights section of the map file.

Maps that have non-zero border heights may display visual effects - gaps in the tile textures at the edges of the map.
